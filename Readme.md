# Space Trace Collisions

Go version of: https://github.com/csenn/space-trace-collisions

Uses SPG4 algorithm from  https://www.space-track.org/ instead for greater accuracy. Requires DLLs to be setup correctly based on machine that is running the program, used the examples in the space-track.org algorithm download to figure out how to get them mapped correctly.

Runs in 70 seconds on M1 processor and is 3-5 times faster than the Python version
